# Code Quiz

## Description

In this assignment, I was to construct a timed quiz using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that was to feature questions related to coding.  After the quiz was completed the quiz taker will be asked to enter their initials and, if their score is high enough, it will be saved on the page's high score list.  This was a fairly difficult task to do, as it required manipulating the DOM to be able to change the page, as I only had one html for it.  This was honestly a very tough assignment for me, and I had to use quite a bit of resources to figure out how to solve the problems that arose, but I really enjoyed it and now have a better understanding of Javascript, in regards to DOM manipulation.

## Usage

When a potential quiz taker opens the page, they will find a start button in the center of the screen, along with a timer above it, and a button to take them to the high scores page in the upper-right corner.  When the quiz taker is ready to take their quiz, they can click on the blue start button, and a question will pop up on the same window, along with four buttons below, each with a potential answer.  Also upon starting the quiz, the timer will begin to countdown, starting at 70, all the way to 0.  Depending on which answer they select, the button may either flash red or green, to signify whether they were correct or incorrect.  Each correct answer will award the quiz taker 5 points, while each incorrect answer subtracts 5 seconds off of the timer.  Once all questions have been answered, the remaining time will be added to the final score, and the screen will show a window for the quiz taker to submit their initials to be potentially recorded into the high scores table, which records the highest 10 scores.

## Credits

As this was a difficult assignment, I had to look up some resources in order to help me overcome obstacles.  Particularly, three Youtube channels were helpful to me, in solving this assignment.

I could not have been able to have done this assignment without consulting these three Youtube channels.  From giving me ideas of how to style my quiz, to helping me figure out further how to use local storage.
